## Topics: Strings and Arrays

* Arrays: ordered lists of items often used for sequential lists
* Strings: sequences of character data.

### Required tasks

**Strings**

- [x] Read String Questions in Interviews.
  - Using a few sentences, describe what you've learned.
- [x] Watch [Memoization and Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Xa2BitN3I) video
  - By using memoization we can speed up our program by storing results of functions that will be repeted multiple times. Instead of running the function each time we store the result and we recall it later when needed.
- [ ] Watch [Anagram Problem Solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MwRGPPB4tw) video
  - Using a few sentences, describe what you've learned.

**Arrays**

- [ ] Read Sorting Algorithms
  - Can you memorize one algorithm? What is it?
- [x] Watch [Introduction to Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkkFqlG0Hds) video
  - sorting allows faster searches. We can classify them by time and space complexity, by stability and by internal and external sort and recursive and non recursive
  
- [x] Watch [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q) video
  - a merge sort works by dividing the list to sort into smaller units and compare each one of them with the adjacent one and then merge them, repeating this process until all the list is sorted

**Coding**

- [x] Set up `exercism` and complete at least 2 exercises using `exercism submit`.

### Optional tasks

- [ ] Do more tasks on exercism
- [ ] Set up an account on Interviewbit.com and start the [Programming course](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)
- [ ] Finish [Time Complexity chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/time-complexity) in Level 1 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Arrays chapter]((https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/arrays/)) in Level 2 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Math chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/math/) in Level 2 of Interviewbit.
